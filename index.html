                I enjoy spending time singing as a member of Granite State Choral Society. Based out of Rochester, NH, "Granite State Choral Society exists to create accessible social experiences that educate, connect and inspire all generations through the power of song." When I'm not working on Bootcamp coursework or participating in GSCS you will find me eating, taking pictures, or gaming on my computer. Because I care about such things, here's the breakdown of my current gaming rig:
            </p>
                <pre class="noBottom">
                    CPU: Intel Core i5 7600k (5ghz overlock)
                    CPU Cooler: EVGA 280mm AIO Cooler
                    GPU: MSI Duke 1070ti (would like to upgrade)
                    RAM: 16GB DDR4-3200
                    PSU: Corsair RM1000
                    Storage: 1tb hard drive (spinning disk), 1tb SATA SSD, 1tb NVMe SSD
                    Case: Some giant Corsair full tower case
                </pre>

            <!-- <p>I'll say a few words about my most time-intensive hobby: Singing as a member of Granite State Choral Society. Based out of Rochester, NH, "Granite State Choral Society exists to create accessible social experiences that educate, connect and inspire all generations through the power of song." Apologies for the spiel-like quality of that last bit, but I am a member of the GSCS Board of Trustees and I like ot plug the org whenever i can! (website is <a href="https://gschoralsociety.org">gschoralsociety.org</a> btw). I am by far the youngest member of the chorus, and I get a real kick out of being a huge outlier in the distribution of ages in the group.. one lone 24 year-old in a sea of 50+ year-olds (although all ages 12+ are welcome). The chorus has undertaken many ambitious projects including Mozart's Requiem, Carmina Burana, and an entire body of work commissioned for the city of Rochester that tells the history of the area (and as a result the broader history of small-town New England.) If you are into choral music or are trying to get a good taste of what the local arts scene has to offer I highly recommend that you check out GSCS.</p> -->
